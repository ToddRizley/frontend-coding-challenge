#Eventable Front End Coding Challenge

Hi! This is a small `react` app integrating Eventable's API. The app receives JSON from an Eventable user, displays the events on that user's calendar, and then gives the user ability to add events (locally). The app is very simple and use is fairly straightforward. 

Technologies used:
* React.js w/ ES6
* moment.js
* jest/enzyme (for testing)
* Bootstrap (for styling)

In order to get the app running locally, follow these steps:

* clone the repository locally
* `cd` into repo folder and run `npm install` in the terminal
* run the dev server via `npm start` enter "y" to run server at `localhost:3000`
* open your browser of choice at navigate to `localhost:3000`


Note to run test suite, in the terminal run `npm test`
